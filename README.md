# SOAPDemo
Android app demo to fetch data from SOAP based APIs.

SOAP API: Text-To-Braille convertor [http://www.webservicex.net/braille.asmx?WSDL]

I've used 2 libraries to fetch the same data from SOAP API:
1) Retrofit
2) KSoap

This demo shows how to use Retrofit as well as KSoap to access SOAP APIs in an Android app. The API I've used is a fairly simple one which converts text messages written in English to Braille.
